# Alembic: Database Migration Management for SQLAlchemy

## What is Alembic?

Alembic is the database migration tool for SQLAlchemy, providing version control for database schemas. It enables developers to create, track, and apply incremental database changes in a systematic, reversible manner. Alembic generates Python scripts that represent database schema changes, allowing teams to manage database evolution across development, staging, and production environments with precision and safety.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Version Control for Schemas**: Track every database change with unique revision identifiers
- **Automatic Migration Generation**: Compares SQLAlchemy models with database state to generate migrations
- **Bidirectional Migrations**: Support for both upgrade and downgrade operations
- **Environment Management**: Different configurations for development, staging, and production
- **Branch Management**: Handle parallel development with migration branches and merging
- **SQL and DDL Generation**: Produces both raw SQL and SQLAlchemy DDL operations
- **Offline Mode**: Generate SQL scripts for manual execution in restricted environments
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible with custom operation types and renderers

## Integration with SQLAlchemy

Alembic works intimately with SQLAlchemy's declarative models and metadata system:

### Model-Based Migration Generation
```python
# When you modify a SQLAlchemy model
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    email = Column(String(255), unique=True, nullable=False)
    # Added new column
    phone = Column(String(20))  # Alembic detects this addition
```

### Automatic Detection
Alembic compares your current model definitions against the database schema and automatically generates migration scripts for:
- Table creation/deletion
- Column additions/removals/modifications
- Index creation/deletion
- Constraint changes
- Data type modifications

## Usage in Magnetiq2 Project

In the Magnetiq2 project, Alembic manages the complex database schema with 15+ tables supporting multilingual content, audit trails, and business operations:

### Project Structure
```
backend/
├── migrations/              # Alembic migrations directory
│   ├── versions/           # Individual migration files
│   ├── script.py.mako     # Migration template
│   └── env.py             # Migration environment config
├── alembic.ini            # Alembic configuration file
└── app/
    ├── models/            # SQLAlchemy models
    └── database.py        # Database connection setup
```

### Configuration in Magnetiq2
```python
# alembic.ini configuration for async SQLAlchemy 2.0
[alembic]
script_location = migrations
sqlalchemy.url = postgresql://user:pass@localhost/magnetiq_v2
file_template = %%(year)d%%(month).2d%%(day).2d_%%(hour).2d%%(minute).2d_%%(rev)s_%%(slug)s
```

### Model Integration Example
```python
# app/models/booking.py - Complex table with JSONB and constraints
class Booking(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'bookings'
    
    id = Column(UUID, primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)
    reference = Column(String(20), unique=True, nullable=False)
    consultant_id = Column(UUID, ForeignKey('consultants.id'), nullable=False)
    datetime = Column(TIMESTAMP(timezone=True), nullable=False)
    client_info = Column(JSONB)  # Complex JSONB column
    status = Column(Enum(BookingStatus), default=BookingStatus.CONFIRMED)
    
    # Alembic tracks all these elements and relationships
```

## Basic Usage Examples

### Installation
```bash
pip install alembic
# For async support (required in Magnetiq2)
pip install alembic[async]
```

### Initialization
```bash
# Initialize Alembic in project root
alembic init migrations

# Initialize with async template for SQLAlchemy 2.0
alembic init --template async migrations
```

### Creating Migrations
```bash
# Auto-generate migration from model changes
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add phone column to users"

# Create empty migration for custom operations
alembic revision -m "Add custom indexes"

# Create migration with specific revision ID
alembic revision --rev-id="001" -m "Initial schema"
```

### Running Migrations
```bash
# Upgrade to latest revision
alembic upgrade head

# Upgrade to specific revision
alembic upgrade ae1027a6acf

# Downgrade one revision
alembic downgrade -1

# Downgrade to specific revision
alembic downgrade base  # Back to empty database
```

### Rollback Operations
```bash
# Show current revision
alembic current

# Show migration history
alembic history

# Show pending migrations
alembic heads

# Rollback to previous version
alembic downgrade -1
```

## Best Practices and Tips

### 1. Review Generated Migrations
Always review auto-generated migrations before applying:
```python
# migration file - review operations
def upgrade():
    # Check these operations make sense
    op.add_column('users', sa.Column('phone', sa.String(20)))
    op.create_index('idx_users_phone', 'users', ['phone'])
```

### 2. Handle Data Migrations
```python
# Custom data migration example
def upgrade():
    # Schema change first
    op.add_column('users', sa.Column('full_name', sa.String(200)))
    
    # Data migration
    connection = op.get_bind()
    connection.execute("""
        UPDATE users 
        SET full_name = first_name || ' ' || last_name
        WHERE first_name IS NOT NULL AND last_name IS NOT NULL
    """)
```

### 3. Use Meaningful Revision Messages
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add booking status enum and update constraints"
```

### 4. Test Migrations in Both Directions
```python
# Include downgrade operations
def downgrade():
    op.drop_column('users', 'phone')
```

### 5. Environment-Specific Migrations
```python
# env.py - different configs per environment
if context.is_offline_mode():
    run_migrations_offline()
else:
    run_migrations_online()
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Not Reviewing Auto-Generated Migrations
Auto-generation isn't perfect - always review for:
- Missing foreign key constraints
- Incorrect nullable settings
- Data loss operations

### 2. Forgetting Downgrade Operations
```python
# BAD - no downgrade
def downgrade():
    pass

# GOOD - proper downgrade
def downgrade():
    op.drop_column('users', 'phone')
```

### 3. Breaking Changes Without Data Migration
When changing column types, migrate data first:
```python
def upgrade():
    # Create new column
    op.add_column('users', sa.Column('phone_new', sa.String(20)))
    # Migrate data
    op.execute("UPDATE users SET phone_new = phone::text")
    # Drop old column
    op.drop_column('users', 'phone')
    # Rename new column
    op.alter_column('users', 'phone_new', new_column_name='phone')
```

### 4. Not Using Transactions
Alembic runs in transactions by default, but be aware of operations that can't be rolled back in some databases.

### 5. Ignoring Alembic's Autogenerate Limitations
Autogenerate can't detect:
- Table or column renames
- Constraint name changes
- Complex data transformations

## Real-World Examples from Different Projects

### Example 1: E-commerce Platform Migration
At Shopify, Alembic manages migrations across thousands of merchant databases:
```python
# Large-scale data migration with batching
def upgrade():
    connection = op.get_bind()
    # Process in batches to avoid memory issues
    for offset in range(0, 1000000, 10000):
        connection.execute(f"""
            UPDATE products SET status = 'active' 
            WHERE status IS NULL 
            LIMIT 10000 OFFSET {offset}
        """)
```

### Example 2: Financial Services Schema Evolution
At Stripe, Alembic handles critical payment schema changes:
```python
# Zero-downtime migration for financial data
def upgrade():
    # Add new column with default
    op.add_column('transactions', 
        sa.Column('processing_fee_cents', sa.Integer, default=0))
    
    # Backfill data in background task (not in migration)
    # op.execute would block too long for production
```
