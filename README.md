We learnt a bunch about operating an AI-coder from [wapsol/voltaic-recharge-hub](https://github.com/wapsol/voltaic-recharge-hub), a website originally produced by Lovable, and converted into a CMS with lead-gen features using ClaudeCode.

We faced challenges:

- the code-base was 300 MB, for a relatively simple app
- Code was inconsistent, as we made architectural changes along the way (ex. content storage is split between code-files, static pages and database), which apparently seems to be confusing the AI-coder.

Now, we want to see if we can..

- specify the final product we want Â±100%,
- vet it in the team across our business requirements, and only then,
- part-by-part, have the AI-coder build it.

And yes, we are leaving this a public project for now.
